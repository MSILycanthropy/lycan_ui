    <p>
      It would be really nice to have the form components accessible from Rails <%= code('form_with') %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, LycanUI supports this out of the box.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you didn't add it when setting up, all you need to do to get this functionality is run,
    </p>

    <pre class="bg-surface-200 dark:bg-surface-900 rounded-lg flex shadow-lg p-6">
      <code>rails generate lycan_ui:add form</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      You'll now have access to <%= code('lycan_ui_form_with') %> in any view context.
    </p>

    <p>
      It functions identically to <%= code('form_with') %>, other than the fact that it renders the styled versions of each form element.
    </p>
  </div>
<% end %>

<%= render 'partials/doc' %>
