## I Have a Question

If you have a question about LycanUI, please be sure to check out the [docs](<https://ui.lycanthropy.dev>). There you'll find examples and walkthroughs of how to use LycanUI.

If the docs aren't sufficient to answer your question, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub, or reach out directly. We're happy to help!

## I Want to Contribute

Contributions come in many shapes and forms. Code is only one of those paths.

- **Feedback** - The most important form of contribution. Tell us what you like, but more importantly what you _don't_.
- **Document** - Our philosophy is pretty feature first. So if you find use cases that aren't documented quite up to snuff, _please_ write a little about it.
- **Report Bugs** - Create issues with bug reports so we can continue to improve LycanUi.
